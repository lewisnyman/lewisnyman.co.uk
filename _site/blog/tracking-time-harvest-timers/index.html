<p>Today I overslept for four hours! Jetlag is maybe the worst of the first world problems.</p>

<p>Recently I started tracking my time more accurately using the <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest desktop app.</a> I used to input how long I worked on a certain project by the hour but I once I built the habit of starting/stopped timers I think I prefer it.</p>

<p>If you work flexible hours, it makes you think about your time carefully, aware that you have a target of billable hours to hit. I&#39;ve found myself more focused, knowing that I should stop the timer if I&#39;m distracted by another task for too long.</p>
