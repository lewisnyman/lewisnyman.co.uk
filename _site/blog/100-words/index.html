<p>Inspired by <a href="https://adactio.com/">Jeremy,</a> I&#39;ve started the 100 words challenge. 100 words every day for 100 days. I&#39;m surprised how much I enjoyed reading Jeremy&#39;s daily slices of life.</p>

<p>This is day two, and I&#39;m jetlagged with nothing else to write about, so I choose to write about the writing challenge. I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m going to write about everyday but I guess that&#39;s part of the fun. I hope it&#39;s going to encourage me to work on this site a little more, as I start to use it often. I&#39;m using <a href="www.hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a> to write these posts, it&#39;s handy!</p>
