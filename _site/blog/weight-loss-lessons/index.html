<p>Today I read an <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/06/18/follow-up-to-how-i-lost-over-40-pounds-using-healthkit-and-apple-watch/">inspiring blog post</a> by Jim Dalrymple, of <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/">The Loop.</a></p>

<p>He wrote about his weight loss of fourty pounds over ten months, which is pretty incredible. For someone who admitted he never though about fitness before now, he has a great attitude. Here are the lessons I&#39;ve learnt.</p>

<h2>Become aware of everything you eat</h2>

<p>Once you understand what your putting in your mouth, you become so much more aware of the decisions you make. Myfitnesspal does a great job at this, not just telling you your calories, but your sodium, protein, carbohydrates, and more. You quickly realise that some foods that are &#39;healthy&#39; really aren&#39;t. That salad would be healthy... if it wasn&#39;t covered in french dressing.</p>

<h2>Don&#39;t become obsessed</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Using MyFitnessPal is an approximation of the food I’m eating every day. I don’t count the number of strawberries I eat, I just say, “Yeah, that’s about a quarter of a cup.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>One day at a time</h2>

<p>I looked at each day in tenths of pounds. If I was down by even one-tenth, that was great for me. If I was up, I looked at what I did the day before that may of caused it. I didn’t feel guilty or beat myself, I just tried to do better.</p>

<h2>Good days and bad days</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>All I wanted to do is try. Every single day. I’ll have some good days and some bad days, but I didn’t care, I’d just try.</p>
</blockquote>
