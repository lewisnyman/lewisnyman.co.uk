<p>As long as I&#39;ve been working with Drupal there&#39;s always been a culture of <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/323993">base themes.</a> They are jumping off points for frontend developers or themers, maintained by the community.</p>

<p>In theory this sounds very close to the open source culture within the Drupal community. Why repeat steps when you can just build on the shoulders and experience of others?</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a big difference between base themes and Drupal modules. Base themes are broad in scope, they all aim to solve the workflow of Drupal theming. They encourage a tribal mentality. Everyone has their base theme of choice that aligns with their workflow. You&#39;re either right or you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>This does not gel with the spirit of open source. Every base theme implements it&#39;s own solution to common frontend problems. They don&#39;t share or reuse code between different base themes.</p>

<p>And what if your desired workflow doesn&#39;t fit with the selection of base themes available? What if you like the implementation of mobile meta tags in Omega but don&#39;t want all the grid nonsense? What if you like the cleanliness of Mothership but also Zen&#39;s sassyness?</p>

<p>I tried maintaining my own base theme when I first start working with Drupal 6. It was a mashup of Basic and Zen if my memory serves me correctly. Of course I don&#39;t use it anymore, maintaining a base theme was a nightmare.</p>

<p>So what choice do you have? One option is to roll your own, inline with your workflow. But the idea of everyone working in their own bubble doesn&#39;t sound open source at all.</p>

<p>The other option is to pick the base theme that is close enough to your workflow. Embrace the maintainer&#39;s overly prescriptive idea of the perfect frontend workflow.</p>

<p>This is not how the Drupal community usually works. You have a luxury of modules that you can combine and reuse together without conflict. If you want to use similar functionality together, you can package them in a distribution.</p>

<p>This is the direction modern frontend development is heading. Loosely coupled components pulled together using <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler,</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm,</a> or <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower.</a> You have a pattern that you want to use again but with minor differences? Create a <a href="https://yeoman.io/generators/official.html">Yeoman generator.</a></p>

<p>We need this mentality in the Drupal theming community. We need to build modular tools that are reusable instead of requiring you to buy into someone else&#39;s philosophy.</p>

<p>Luckily, we are already seeing signs of base themes moving in this direction. The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/aurora">Magic module</a> is a result of a collaboration between the maintainers of the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/aurora">Aurora</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/omega">Omega 4.x</a> base themes. Instead of rewriting the same performance improvements in every base theme, why not share the code and improve them together.</p>

<p>The Magic module is already showing signs of a broad scope, after all, who can control magic? No one. I do hope it maintains a modular architecture that allows me to choose the benefits for myself instead of requiring a big buy into the maintainer&#39;s vision.</p>

<p>Maybe the concept of a base theme is flawed? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;d love to see more collaboration between base theme maintainers because at the end of the day it would benefit all of us.</p>
