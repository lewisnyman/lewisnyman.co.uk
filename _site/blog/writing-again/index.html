<p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve written here. The trip to Minneapolis in June threw my mojo off and once I lost my routine it became easy to not write.</p>

<p>Loads has happened in the past two months! I spoke at <a href="http://drupalcampnorth.org/">Drupal Camp North,</a> I sprinted on Drupal 8 at <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/474418">Wunderkraut Munich.</a> I just got back from Dublin where I attended the last excellent <a href="hybridconf.net">HybridConf.</a> It was a common theme of conversation how much the conference would be missed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to miss Hybrid, like <a href="http://2013.buildconf.com/">Build,</a> and <a href="http://newadventuresconf.com/">New Adventures in Web Design</a> before it. It feels like a friendly home, and it&#39;s really hard to pull that off.</p>

<p>I hope we find a way of producing this kind of conference without expecting someone to burn out or lose money year-on-year.</p>
