<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJlm58wZCUM">Bogota,</a> Todd spoke about the idea of a company culture that either focused on the company or focused on the people within.</p>

<p>When we refer to the needs of “the company” who are we really talking about? When I&#39;ve worked in organisations with a strong heriachy, where reference to the needs and objectives of the company are basically the needs of management. When working in flatter organisations, I rarely hear a reference to the needs of “the company”. There are more “we”s and “I”s.</p>

<p>Now, I listen out for “the company”  as a culture smell, a sign of people&#39;s needs being overriden by management.</p>
