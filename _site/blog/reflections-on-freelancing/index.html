<p>It&#39;s been about 10 months since I switched from freelancing to working back under a real organisation. I was freelancing for maybe a year and a half. Back in 2012 I had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>I quit full-time employment and set up Lewis Nyman Design ltd. It took a leap of faith but I haven't looked back. The freedom suits me and I've been able to learn a lot more working together with so many smart people.</blockquote>

<p>I was happy with the freedom and control I had after feeling stifled in full-time employment.</p>

<p>But I also found contracting a little lonely. I&#39;d parachute into companies with close knit teams and ways of working. Everyone there knows you&#39;re a temporary resource, even though the best companies I worked with made me feel part of the team.</p>

<p>You&#39;re hired to do a job, get on with it, and move on. I  struggled with the instinct to be bold and improve things I found that could be better. Sometimes changes are just not wanted, especially from the contractor who might not even be here tomorrow.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve put faith in high standards and enthusiasm that have got me this far in my career, so keeping my head down feels very unnatural.</p>

<p>Even though I enjoyed the financial freedom, I had a desire to find a team of people that I could trust and who trusted me. People with complementary skills sets to mine, that can fill in the areas I am weak, and respectfully challenge me.</p>

<p>So when I met with <a href="http://www.steveparks.co.uk/">Steve P</a> for a chat, I really wasn&#39;t sure what I wanted. To be honest I knew very little about WunderKraut before then. As it happened, everything he was aiming for aligned with mine.</p>

<p>It took a leap of faith to jump into my own business, and it was a leap of faith to jump back out. I don&#39;t regret either decision. Objectives change over time with experiences and perspective.</p>
