<p>At FOSDEM, <a href="https://twitter.com/royscholten">Roy</a> shared his experiences on the Drupal project and his advice for anyone looking to increase UX design in their own project.</p>

<h2>Why bother with UX?</h2>

<ul>
<li>It must be usable, if a user can&#39;t install it they can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s useful to them.</li>
<li>Once they know, there are probably other products available, so you need to make your product delightful or desirable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drupal retrospective</h2>

<h3>Drupal 6</h3>

<ul>
<li>Drupal was getting popular, there were many complaints that it was hard to use.</li>
<li>Initiated two full blown usability tests.</li>
<li>The results were disastrous. Even with a help desk to call, no one made it through.</li>
<li>PANIC</li>
<li>The community realised it had to do something about it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drupal 7</h3>

<ul>
<li>Dries blogged, critical UX issues, Drupal 7 is not getting released without it. Put UX in the spotlight.</li>
<li>The community UX team was formed.</li>
<li>The community struggled to make an impact, improvements were iterative.</li>
<li>Two professional designers outside the community were hired by Acquia, to develop a grander vision for Drupal 7.</li>
<li>They did design research, usability testing, developed a grander vision for Drupal 7. 80,000 euros for half a year were spent.</li>
<li>Drupal 7 was lab tested, the critical usability issues were fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drupal 8</h3>

<ul>
<li>After the grander problems were fixed, we could focus on more specific efforts. For example the content creation form.</li>
<li>Drupal is a large project, everyone has an opinion about design. Every design issue does not get committed under 100 comments.</li>
<li>Codifying patterns and best practices, drawing up guidelines on how to implemented UI consistently.</li>
<li>Moving towards smaller, more focused releases after Drupal 8.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bootstrapping usability</h2>

<h3>Usability tests</h3>

<ul>
<li>Avoid opinion based  discussions by using data.</li>
<li>&quot;7/10 people struggled to complete this task, we have to change something&quot;</li>
<li>Recorded usability tests show people the pain of users.</li>
<li>Pre-Drupal 6 - the implementors of Drupal were also the users, the technical and user mental models were mixed.</li>
<li>It sets a baseline, the next test will show you if you&#39;ve improved.</li>
<li>Students who were involved in the project had access to a lab, the community UX test helped write the test script.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reviews</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ask an interaction designer to review the UI, they can help prioritise problems.</li>
<li>Be open to reviews</li>
<li>Look at the support requests for common user problems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build a design culture</h3>

<ul>
<li>The project lead has to champion the vision, for example, not releasing Drupal 7 until the UX issues were fixed</li>
<li>Develop a design vision for the project, develop principles</li>
<li>Set priorities, you have to make trade offs</li>
<li>Allow for the design process to happen, adapt the tools and processes to help the designers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tools and processes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Create a design tag to make the design issues easy to find</li>
<li>Post screen shots in issues, so it&#39;s easy for designers to review UI changes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Help Developers get better at design</h4>

<ul>
<li>Teach developers about learnability, efficiency and performances, memorability, safety, satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Show the work</h3>

<ul>
<li>Document and publish usability studies and improvements and guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Attracting designers</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t try and get many designers at once, one designer can make enough work for many developers!</li>
<li>Try and make strong relationships with few designers</li>
<li>Make a clear point of entry on your site for designers.</li>
<li>Start with your own user base</li>
</ul>
