<p>Whoops! Turns out you shouldn&#39;t write a blog title “Writing Again”. That&#39;s a bit of a jinx and it means you won&#39;t write again for another three months.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a good week this week. A fair amount of designing without development. More than I expected to do and more than I&#39;ve done in a long time which is a nice surprise. </p>

<p>Tomorrow is <a href="http://2015.ampersandconf.com">Ampersand Conf 2015.</a> I had a good chat with some of the attendees over a burger and beers and I&#39;m looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Best keep it short and sweet. In case I use up my writing juices for another three months.</p>

<p>Chao!</p>
