<p>Today I began looking over the session submission for the frontend track of Drupalcon Barcelona. There are some impressive looking talks with a good variety. I&#39;m excited for the conference already and I haven&#39;t even finished going through them all.</p>

<p>Today was also about settling back in to life in ZÃ¼rich. I went for a decent run, with 100+ squats halfway through. I  think I&#39;ll struggle to walk tomorrow!</p>

<p>I also booked my flights to Minneapolis on the 21st. I&#39;ll be helping run the Drupal 8 usability test there, as well as helping run the sprints during Drupalcamp Twin Cities.</p>
