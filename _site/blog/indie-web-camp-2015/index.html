<p>Last Saturday I attended my first <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/2015/Brighton">Indie Web Camp.</a> I&#39;ve been using this site a lot more recently and I&#39;ve been really excited to improve and add to it. I like the idea of owning my own data, but it&#39;s always felt like a mammoth task to real in all the services I rely on. </p>

<p>I run my site on Jekyll, it felt like a big barrier to getting my data in and out of the static site.</p>

<p>I found a fellow ex-gowalla user in <a href="https://adactio.com">Jeremy</a> and we briefly lamented the <a href="http://www.quora.com/Where-did-my-Gowalla-data-go">lack of data export</a> years after the <a href="http://blog.gowalla.com/">Facebook acquisition.</a></p>

<p>I learned a lot about the <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/Principles">principles of the Indie Web movement,</a> and how to achieve this using <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE,</a> <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS">PESOS,</a> and <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed">Backfeed.</a></p>

<p>I also found out about <a href="http://indiewebify.me/">IndieWebify.Me,</a> a step-by-step guide to owning your own data. This felt achievable! I no longer felt intimidated.</p>

<p>I using the validation tools I realised my login links did work as expected. <a href="https://github.com/lewisnyman/lewisnyman.co.uk-source/commit/b1c7bf17f6e278e35ccbfd79cd22c210073e10bd">I added invisible links in the head of every page.</a></p>

<p>At the end of the day we went for a drink and I introduced a few people to Burger Brothers. That&#39;s always enjoyable.</p>

<p>The Sunday was the hack day, which I missed because I was up in London hanging out with family. I did get a chance to work on my site a little, and luckily for me there were other attendees who were running Jekyll sites I could learn from as they were working through the same problems I was.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://benjamin.parry.is/writing/testing-webmentions/">Benjamin Parry</a> and <a href="https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2015/07/webmentions">Paul Robert Lloyd</a> for working out in the open, <a href="https://github.com/lewisnyman/lewisnyman.co.uk-source/issues/12">enabling my own attempts at implementing Webmentions</a>.</p>

<p>If I&#39;ve done this correctly, they should receive a webmention on their site.</p>
