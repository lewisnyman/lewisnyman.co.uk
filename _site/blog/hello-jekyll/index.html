<p class="intro">Late last year I ported my personal site from Drupal to Jekyll. When I've mentioned this in passing to people I get odd looks.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a <a href="/blog/seven">Drupal 8 core maintainer</a> which means I spend a lot of time improving Drupal. I also get paid to work with Drupal but moving off of Drupal for my personal site wasn&#39;t a tough decision at all, it made perfect sense.</p>

<p>Before I started at <a href="http://wunderroot.com">WunderRoot</a> I had a nice chat over a pub lunch with one of the co-founders <a href="http://steveparks.co.uk">Steve Parks</a>. He was telling me about the company&#39;s commitment to the “right tool for the job”, be that internal or recommendations for clients, despite being a largely Drupal-focused agency.</p>

<p>He mentioned to me “We wouldn&#39;t use a project management tool built in Drupal, we&#39;d use the best project management tool available, like Jira. We wouldn&#39;t use Drupal to build an internal network, we&#39;d use the product for the job.”</p>

<p>“I guess your blog is built in Wordpress then?” I joked. Surprisingly I learnt that this was a serious consideration at the time. I was also unaware that Steve has moved his personal site to <del>Wordpress</del> <a href="http://www.steveparks.co.uk/">Jekyll</a> for similar reasons.</p>

<p>Well informed, objective decisions impress me.</p>

<p>In the coming days I kept thinking about this conversation. What benefits was I getting out of using Drupal for my own personal site an were they worth the cost? Let&#39;s look at my requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>I care about HTML. Let&#39;s go into why another time. Good markup is good, agreed?</li>
<li>I don&#39;t need a WYSIWYG to create content. I wrote all my posts in HTML.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t have any complex data structures or requirements. The site is pretty minimal.</li>
<li>I like having control over the front-end output, where assets are loaded, and when. This means I can optimise the front-end performance using modern techniques without worrying about breaking the framework.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t know anything about server side performance. I was paying about £15 a month for <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com">Pantheon hosting</a> just so I didn&#39;t have to worry about development workflow and caching and everything else that is out of my ballpark.</li>
</ol>

<p>Looking at this list objectively, Drupal looks like a terrible fit. I wasn&#39;t doing Drupal any favours by using it for a purpose it didn&#39;t suit and I wasn&#39;t doing myself any favours by wading through PHP and config screens <em>removing</em> redundant CSS and markup.</p>

<p>Looking at this list objectively, a static site generator sounded right up my street. I&#39;d used <a href="http://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> before and loved it but I was well aware of the ubiquitous nature of Jekyll and decided it was popular enough be worthing checking out. I also found a very tasty <a href="https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb">Yeoman generator for Jekyll</a> which included a ton of Grunt tasks for Compass, instant local server with LiveReload, various lints, and concatenation and minification of all-the-things from the get go. What a great opportunity to learn new techniques!</p>

<p>My Drupal theme was already built on Sass so moving that over was pretty easy. The <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import/blob/master/lib/jekyll-import/importers/drupal7.rb">Drupal to Jekyll importer</a> was actually easier than I expected and worth using.</p>

<p>Next up: hosting. I was looking for an opportunity to use Heroku but found it was too yak-shavey just to serve HTML files. Github was the next obvious option as it is free and has built in support for Jekyll. By this point I had a pretty beefy <code>grunt build</code> task and it didn&#39;t look like Github could support that so instead I ended up creating <a href="https://github.com/lewisnyman/lewisnyman.co.uk-source">one repo for the source code</a> and another that actually <a href="https://github.com/lewisnyman/lewisnyman.github.io">hosts the site</a>. I use the <a href="https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control">Grunt build control task</a> to push the compiled and minified code to the hosting repo.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The main reason for moving house to Jekyll was to ease development and gain a tighter control over front-end performance. While I was porting over it did give me a chance to make some improvements. Let&#39;s compare the old and the new <a href="/">homepage</a> (excluding Google Analytics and Typekit).</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Old:</strong> — 2.6kb</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> — 1.0kb</li>
</ul>

<h3>CSS</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Old:</strong> — One request, 3.0kb</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> — One request, 1.8kb</li>
</ul>

<h3>Javascript</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Old:</strong> — Three requests, 43.6kb</li>
<li><strong>New:</strong> — Two requests, 5.432kb</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you couldn&#39;t get better results than this with Drupal but it is a lot harder to do so. I&#39;m pretty happy with having all the control in the front-end. There are still more improvements to make and I&#39;m looking forward to rolling out the next facets of the site design in 2014.</p>
