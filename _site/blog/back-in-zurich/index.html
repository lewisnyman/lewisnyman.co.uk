<p>Last night I flew back to ZÃ¼rich after a month away either in the UK or the USA. I forgot what it was like to relax, never being far from a backpack I have to rifle through to find my what I need for the day.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten pretty good at packing, but I think that&#39;s allowed me to take more then I really need on trips. If I want to be able to live anywhere in the future I need to shed more weight from around me, and learn to maintain a routine when everything else is changing.</p>
