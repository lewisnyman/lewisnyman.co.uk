<p>I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://www.moves-app.com/">Moves</a> constantly for two and a half years, mainly because you don&#39;t have to do anything to use it. Not even open the app.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a free pedometer/calorie counter, and it has the added benefit of not needing to be &#39;turned on&#39; when you&#39;re going to a run or a cycle. It logs everything.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been using <a href="myfitnesspal.com">Myfitnesspal</a> on and off. It&#39;s really good at tracking calories ingested, containing a huge database of food information.</p>

<p>What I really wanted was for the burned calories logged in Moves to be deducted from my ingested calories in Myfitnesspal. It&#39;s possible, but not without a bit of fiddling.</p>

<p>Moves connects with <a href="https://apps.moves-app.com/">several apps,</a> one being <a href="http://www.moves-export.com/">Moves Export.</a> Moves export is pretty cool in itself, it allows you to automatically checkin to Foursquare and export GPS and JSON. It can also post directly to <a href="http://runkeeper.com">Runkeeper.</a></p>

<p>Runkeeper is the link between the two apps, Moves Export posts to Runkeeper, and <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/apps/show/102">Runkeeper connects with Myfitnesspal.</a></p>

<p>Once you have that chain setup, voil√†. You have automatic fitness tracking from Moves to Myfitnesspal.</p>
