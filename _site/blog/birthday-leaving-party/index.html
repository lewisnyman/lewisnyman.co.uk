<p>OK so I didn&#39;t blog for the past two days. I&#39;ve had two full days. It&#39;s more important not to fall than not to stumble.</p>

<p>Saturday involved a trip to the <a href="http://eorailway.co.uk/">Epping Railway</a> and a trip though the lovely countryside for my Dad&#39;s birthday. The evening involved rushing to see of my good friend <a href="http://samdransfield.tumblr.com/">Sam,</a> who&#39;s leaving England to ply his trade on the west coast, Los Angeles. I&#39;ll miss him.</p>

<p>Sunday involved a hungover shamble around Brighton for Breakfast in Kemptown, an ice cream at <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/marroccos/4ba4f456f964a52009c838e3">Marrocoo&#39;s,</a> and a swim in the sea. Not a bad end to the week.</p>
