<p>The other day I listened to an episode of <a href="https://friendshipping.simplecast.fm">Friendshipping,</a> a podcast about friendship and how to be a good friend.</p>

<p><a href="https://friendshipping.simplecast.fm/episodes/12810-advice-on-giving-advice">The episode was about giving advice</a> and it was great for me. I&#39;m someone who can&#39;t help but open their mouth to “help”, even when advice was never asked for.</p>

<p>Part of the discussion was asking for permission before giving advice. Not “Can I give you some advice?” because that sounds condescending. It&#39;s better to say &quot;Let me know if you want some feedback, I&#39;d be happy to help&quot;.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that brilliant? Learning to be a better person is fun.</p>
