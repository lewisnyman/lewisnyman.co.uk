<p>Last night our neighbors had a party that lasted until 7am. Fuck them.</p>

<p>Despite that ruining the morning, I had a great day. I helped Emma get Jekyll up and running on her local so she could play around with her personal site. I also drew a few wireframes based on her content requirements to get her started.</p>

<p>Then I went running with my Vibrams, tri-shorts, and a waterproof bag to stash my gear. I ran and swam up and down the Limmat river. It&#39;s my favourite summer past time in ZÃ¼rich.</p>

<p>Then I raced Josef to <a href="http://www.kafiduzis.ch/">Kafi Duzis</a> where they had a bad and an awesome live band playing. The heavens opened but that didn&#39;t stop the fun.</p>
