<p>Last night was was a bad night for me, a good night for jetlag. I slept from 12am–3:30am.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on the train back from London to Haywards Heath after a nice celebration dinner for the <a href="http://jac.judiciary.gov.uk">JAC project.</a> We&#39;ve reached what we call the “end of the beginning” of the project and that means everyone involved, client and team, have a nice evening out to celebrate a job done.  I love how much emphasis we put into celebrating our achievements. It&#39;s a real morale booster when it&#39;s easy to loose track of all the good work that&#39;s done over the project.</p>
