<p>This site is an experiment in sustainable design.</p>
<p>The web has broken free. It's no longer confined to the desk. Users have become liberated, they are untethered. People are accessing the web from a rapidly increasing number of devices.</p>
<p>By designing a site for a particular group we risk excluding others. How can we build a site that will be flexible enough to adapt and function on devices of the past, present and future? Can we make sites that are truly future friendly?</p>
<p>This site is an experiment.</p>
<p>I'm stripping away all assumptions about the constraints and capabilities of today's devices and starting with one solid baseline. A site that is so basic that it's likely to function on every device. True accessibility.</p>
<p>Starting from this baseline, I'm going to be progressively enhancing aspects of the site design conditionally, based on the feature and capabilities I can detect from your device.</p><p>Here's my roadmap:</p>
<ol><li>Colour</li> <li>Touch Input</li> <li>Larger Real Estate</li> <li>JSON Support</li>  <li>High Resolution</li> <li>Pointer Device Input</li> <li>Network Connection</li> <li>Battery</li> <li>User Proximity</li> <li>Environmental factors</li></ol>
<p>For now I'm starting with the basics, plain old universally accissible type.</p>
<p>I'm going to be blogging my entire process. At worst this experiment will be a few lessons learned.</p>
