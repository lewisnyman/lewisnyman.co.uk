At Drupalcon Denver I gave a presentation on Responsive Web Design. The concepts I talked about came out of months and months of research and drafting, and well over a year of staring out the window and thinking about the world.

I'm going to write some posts detailing the process I went though when developing the presentation because I found it really interesting but for now I'm going to try and bring together all related materials in one place.
