<p>Whilst playing with the Chrome team's latest experiment, <a href="http://chrome.com/supersyncsports/">Super sync sports,</a> I started thinking about the potential for web experiences that embace a multi device world. Not just by supporting all the devices that someone could use, but by acknowledging that most people have more than one device at their disposal. It's still pretty rare, on the web, to accept these sequential device interactions let alone encourage it.</p>

<blockquote>It’s time to stop imagining that smartphones, tablets, and desktops are containers that each hold their own content, optimized for a particular browsing or reading experience. Users don’t think of it that way. Instead, users imagine that each device is its own window onto the web.</blockquote>

<h2>Common misconceptions</h2>

<q>Most mobile users don't make us any money, what's the benefit in supporting them?</q>
<q>Why would somebody want to do that on a phone?</q>
<q>Mobile users need only the essential information, desktop users have time to spare</q>

<p>There are many encouraging examples of software companies getting wise to the fact that people do not use their devices in complete segregation. They chop and change between them throughout the day, sometimes even using both simultaneously. One single task may be completed on multiple devices. Here are some examples of these flows in action.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I find an article written by you. I want to read it later. I save it to a third party service that allows me to pull it back up when I'm somewhere more comfortable or boring.</li>
<li>I want to buy a flight online. I research the best price flight on my way to work but I only buy the flight once I'm at home an able to discuss it.</li>
<li>I've been sent a document I need to full out, sign, and send back. I fill out the document using a keyboard, forward it to my touch enabled device to sign, and then return it to the original sender.</li>
<li>I might set up</li>
</ul>
