<p class="intro">I design nifty interactions & experiences for big, small, medium, kinda-small, and sorta-big devices.</p>

<p>I care about happiness, openess, spreading knowledge, healthy bodies and minds.</p>

<p>I've worked alongside some top-notch humans on projects for The Ministry of Justice, Kew Gardens, Royal Mail, and Comic Relief.</p>
