<p>The start of a new year is a cliche but it's a cliche for a reason. I think the opportunity to reflect, set your goals, and pull yourself towards them with new energy is powerful motivation.</p>

<p>One of the goals I'm setting myself is to read more. I don't mean the kind of reading where you're standing up, stuck in a sweaty train carriage, and surrounded by thirty people breathing down your neck. I mean the kind of reading where you're sitting comfortably, it's peacefully quiet, and theres a hot drink within arms reach.</p>

<p>One of my other goals is to write more, partly because I feel guilty setting up this site with the intention of pumping it full of content and I've ended up neglecting it. Partly because I enjoy it. What better way is there to start moving forward than by facing backwards and reflecting on the year that has been.</p>

<p>2013, you have a tough act to follow.</p>

<p>I like to think that every year I've had since leaving compulsory education has been an improvement on the last; the <q>Best Year Ever â„¢</q>. 2012 has been especially sweet, I'm really pleased the things I've learnt and achieved. I'm going to have to step it up a in 2013.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>I wrote a fair few articles, including one published in  <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/where-are-our-absolute-css-units">.net magazine.</a> I also wrote a lot of posts supporting the mobile work I've been doing in Drupal, including <a href="http://drupalwatchdog.com/issue/toc/2/2">one article printed on dead trees!</a> More on that later.</p>

<h2>Speaking</h2>

<p>Busy year! I presented three times in 2012. I hadn't spoken in front of a large crowd before so talking about Responsive Web Design in a packed out room on the first session slot of <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/">Drupalcon Denver</a> was pretty intense. I also presented on Designing for Touch at <a href="http://2012.badcamp.net/program/mobile-summit">BADcamp</a> which was tons of fun. I'm so grateful to <a href="https://twitter.com/eatings">David Hwang</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jenlampton">Jen Lampton</a> for dragging me out to California.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>Work continued on the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/mobile/drupal-8">Drupal 8 Mobile Initiative.</a> I spent a lot of free time iterating on prototypes based off the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/191593">design goals</a> and <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/172059">usability testing. It culminated in <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/232653">this call to action.</a> A lot of the design work I did lives on though the <a href="http://buytaert.net/spark-update-mobile-administration-in-drupal">Drupal Spark Distribution</a> which is kicking butts left, right, and center.</p>

<p>I've also contributed code that made its way into Drupal 8! Eleven issues impresses me anyway. I literally had no idea how to even begin to contribute code at the beginning of the year so I'm pleased I've learnt how to help out. Huge props to <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnAlbin">John Albin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/adaptivethemes">Jeff Burnz</a> who helped me on my way and gave me the confidence to try.</p>

<p>I became heavily involved the initiative to port the Drupal.org theme to Drupal Seven, and while we were at it, making it a bit responsive. I flew out to a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/223439">sprint in Portland</a> to meet with <a href="https://twitter.com/rupl">Rupl</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/banghouse">Banghouse</a> to get things sorted! We did a good job of working out what we needed to do and what we needed to do it, which manifested in <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/236988">this post</a>. Hot debate rightly ensued and in the end <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/236988"></a>we decided to go with the SASS grid framework Susy.</p>

<p>I went to seven conferences in total this year including the fantastic <a href="http://2012.fromthefront.it/">Treasure of Front-End Island,</a> <a href="http://2012.buildconf.com/">Build,</a> and <a href="http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/">New Adventures in Web Design.</a> <a href="http://munich2012.drupal.org/">Drupalcon Munich</a> and <a href="http://www.badcamp.net/">BADcamp</a> were also great because I got to hang out with so many friends.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.vizify.com/">Vizify</a> my most popular tweet of the year was about <a href="https://www.vizify.com/lewis-nyman/year-on-twitter">floppy disks and lassos.</a> I don't know if this is a useful metric but maybe I should consider writing a book on the subject.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>I quit full-time employment and set up Lewis Nyman Design ltd. It took a leap of faith but I haven't looked back. The freedom suits me and I've been able to learn a lot more working together with so many smart people.</p>

<p>I started a business venture with two guys I'd never met before, and then subsequently left six months later. I'm not one for quitting and backing out was a tough decision to make. In the end it was the right decision and I hope the best for Jimmy and Stefan with Teamdeal.co. I've definitely learnt a lot about business and about myself that I'll be putting to good use in 2013.</p>

<h2>The rest</h2>

<p>I fell in love and moved in with my best friend :-)</p>

<h2>So Far, So Good</h2>

<p>I've a lot of work to do to make 2013 the best year ever. Time to start facing forward.</p>
