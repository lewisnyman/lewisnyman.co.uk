    <p class="intro">I am one of your users. I'm on your website right now. </p>
<p class="intro">Can you tell me why?</p>
<p>The internet is a multi-tool for life, people use it to pay their bills, communicate with friends and family, find employment, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>I'm shopping on Amazon for a book that will expand my knowledge base and make me a better designer. This will make me happy.</p>
<p>I'm organising a get together with some old friends on Facebook. This will make me happy.</p>
<p>I'm paying off my credit card statements on Halifax so I can eventually remove the grey cloud lurking over my head. This will make me happy.</p>
<p>Every visitor to a website is on one thing, the <strong>Pursuit of Happiness</strong>.<br>
So can you tell me why visitors are coming to your site?<br>
are your designs helping them achieve their goal or hindering them?</p>
<p>For every addition you make you need to ask yourself <q>Is this going to help my users on the pursuit of happiness or is it a speedbump?</q></p>
<blockquote><p><q>If you're not solving a problem you're invariably going to create one.</q> <cite>Eric Reiss</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>It's safe to assume that you're here to read an article, above and below this you see more article. To the east and the west there is a pattern, unique to this article, that I hope communicates the content visually.<br>
I hope from the split second you land on the page, without even reading a word, you have <em>some</em> idea what the article is about.</p>
<p>Would the date of the post help you decide if you want to read it?<br>
Would a <q><em>Tweet This!</em></q> button?<br>
Would a list of articles you didn't come here to read?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>I am still considering whether I need a navigation bar at the top of this page at all.</p>
<blockquote><p><q>I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold</q> <cite>Kid Cudi</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Let's pretend for a second that what I want you to do and what you want to do are different things. Ideally I want you to read the article, post some feedback, share it with your friends and check out the rest of the site.<br>
Maybe if I was more entrepreneurial I would throw a few advertisements in to pay for the cost of hosting the site.</p>
<p>But you are only here one thing, to read the article and leave.<br>
Maybe then you feel happy and content.</p>
<p>I could try and influence your path through the site using brightly coloured buttons, pictures and sexy animation. Is that stimulating my pursuit of happiness or yours? The best I can do is help you on your way.</p>
<p>Chauffeur you through the article with smart typography and few distractions then wave you on your way when we reach our final destination.</p>
<p>Then, maybe you'll leave happy. You might even want to pass the happiness on to your friends.</p>
