I'm writing this flying from Austin to London. The past three weeks in the US has been amazing. Highlights include: Exploring the many faces of LA, flamingo and ostrich feeding, walking the Vegas strip, joshua tree under the stars, warming up pizza in a sun oven, spotting elk and chipmunks in the grand canyon, frozen margaritas, tacos, a shrimp boil, and tacos. 

Tacos.

Thanks to everyone who made Emma and I feel welcome and super happy. I feel spoilt with kindness.

In other news, the timing of this flight overlaps with the FA cup final! The suspense is killing me!
