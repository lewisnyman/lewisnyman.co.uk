Finally after being out of the country for so long and moving flat in the weekends inbetween we had a chance to spend time in Zürich.

The weather defied the predictions and instead of being wet it was glorious! We cycled around Zürich picking up some goods for the flat (mostly hangers), some food to cook in the coming days, and a Fitbit Aria Wifi scale to help loose some of that fat that built up over the weeks of drinking and dining in the USA.

After that, catching up on Game of Thrones. More Tyrion Lanister please!

And more wine!
