Last Saturday I attended my first [Indie Web Camp.](https://indiewebcamp.com/2015/Brighton) I've been using this site a lot more recently and I've been really excited to improve and add to it. I like the idea of owning my own data, but it's always felt like a mammoth task to real in all the services I rely on. 

I run my site on Jekyll, it felt like a big barrier to getting my data in and out of the static site.

I found a fellow ex-gowalla user in [Jeremy](https://adactio.com) and we briefly lamented the [lack of data export](http://www.quora.com/Where-did-my-Gowalla-data-go) years after the [Facebook acquisition.](http://blog.gowalla.com/)

I learned a lot about the [principles of the Indie Web movement,](https://indiewebcamp.com/Principles) and how to achieve this using [POSSE,](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE) [PESOS,](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS) and [Backfeed.](https://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed)

I also found out about [IndieWebify.Me,](http://indiewebify.me/) a step-by-step guide to owning your own data. This felt achievable! I no longer felt intimidated.

I using the validation tools I realised my login links did work as expected. [I added invisible links in the head of every page.](https://github.com/lewisnyman/lewisnyman.co.uk-source/commit/b1c7bf17f6e278e35ccbfd79cd22c210073e10bd)

At the end of the day we went for a drink and I introduced a few people to Burger Brothers. That's always enjoyable.

The Sunday was the hack day, which I missed because I was up in London hanging out with family. I did get a chance to work on my site a little, and luckily for me there were other attendees who were running Jekyll sites I could learn from as they were working through the same problems I was.

Thanks to [Benjamin Parry](http://benjamin.parry.is/writing/testing-webmentions/) and [Paul Robert Lloyd](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2015/07/webmentions) for working out in the open, [enabling my own attempts at implementing Webmentions](https://github.com/lewisnyman/lewisnyman.co.uk-source/issues/12).

If I've done this correctly, they should receive a webmention on their site.
