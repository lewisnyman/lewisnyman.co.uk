Since the turn of the year I've been listening obsessively to The Flophouse. It's a podcast where three friends watch a bad movie and then talk about it. It is hilarious. If you're thinking along the lines of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" you're not far off.

The trio of friends: Elliot, Stuart, and Dan, have great chemistry and a tendency for comedy improv. Two of the hosts are also comedy writers, and use their knowledge of writing to rip the movies to shreds. It was a permanent fixture during our roadtrip through America.
