<blockquote>Workaholics aren't heroes. They don't save the day, they just use it up. The real hero is home because she figured out a faster way</blockquote>

Since reading [Rework](http://37signals.com/rework/) five years ago, one of the chapters that keeps bubbling up into my mind is [Fire the workaholics](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/902-fire-the-workaholics).

Sadly, this is because I still see too many workaholics who are so influential in their own company that they really should know better. What you do in your company sets expectations and it sets the foundation of the the culture of the company.

If you have the power to set the culture of a company, please be responsible.
