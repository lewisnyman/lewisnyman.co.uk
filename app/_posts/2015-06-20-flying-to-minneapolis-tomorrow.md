Tomorrow I'll be catching a flight to Minneapolis, via Amsterdam. The total travel time is over ten hours, so I'm brainstorming something to be productive with on the trip.

I'm also really looking forward to improving this site. Now that I'm using it more and more people are visiting it, it feels like a higher priority to me now.
