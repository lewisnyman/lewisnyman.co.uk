title: A Birthday and a leaving party
---

OK so I didn't blog for the past two days. I've had two full days. It's more important not to fall than not to stumble. 

Saturday involved a trip to the [Epping Railway](http://eorailway.co.uk/) and a trip though the lovely countryside for my Dad's birthday. The evening involved rushing to see of my good friend [Sam,](http://samdransfield.tumblr.com/) who's leaving England to ply his trade on the west coast, Los Angeles. I'll miss him.

Sunday involved a hungover shamble around Brighton for Breakfast in Kemptown, an ice cream at [Marrocoo's,](https://foursquare.com/v/marroccos/4ba4f456f964a52009c838e3) and a swim in the sea. Not a bad end to the week.
