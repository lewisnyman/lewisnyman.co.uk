title: Advice on giving advice
---

The other day I listened to an episode of [Friendshipping,](https://friendshipping.simplecast.fm) a podcast about friendship and how to be a good friend.

[The episode was about giving advice](https://friendshipping.simplecast.fm/episodes/12810-advice-on-giving-advice) and it was great for me. I'm someone who can't help but open their mouth to "help", even when advice was never asked for. 

Part of the discussion was asking for permission before giving advice. Not "Can I give you some advice?" because that sounds condescending. It's better to say "Let me know if you want some feedback, I'd be happy to help". 

Isn't that brilliant? Learning to be a better person is fun.
