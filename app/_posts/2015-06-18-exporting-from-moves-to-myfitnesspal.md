title: Exporting from moves to Myfitnesspal
---

I've been using [Moves](https://www.moves-app.com/) constantly for two and a half years, mainly because you don't have to do anything to use it. Not even open the app.

It's a free pedometer/calorie counter, and it has the added benefit of not needing to be 'turned on' when you're going to a run or a cycle. It logs everything.

I've also been using [Myfitnesspal](myfitnesspal.com) on and off. It's really good at tracking calories ingested, containing a huge database of food information.

What I really wanted was for the burned calories logged in Moves to be deducted from my ingested calories in Myfitnesspal. It's possible, but not without a bit of fiddling.

Moves connects with [several apps,](https://apps.moves-app.com/) one being [Moves Export.](http://www.moves-export.com/) Moves export is pretty cool in itself, it allows you to automatically checkin to Foursquare and export GPS and JSON. It can also post directly to [Runkeeper.](http://runkeeper.com)

Runkeeper is the link between the two apps, Moves Export posts to Runkeeper, and [Runkeeper connects with Myfitnesspal.](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/apps/show/102)

Once you have that chain setup, voil√†. You have automatic fitness tracking from Moves to Myfitnesspal.
