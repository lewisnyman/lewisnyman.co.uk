title: Drupalcon frontend track
---

Today I began looking over the session submission for the frontend track of Drupalcon Barcelona. There are some impressive looking talks with a good variety. I'm excited for the conference already and I haven't even finished going through them all.

Today was also about settling back in to life in ZÃ¼rich. I went for a decent run, with 100+ squats halfway through. I  think I'll struggle to walk tomorrow!

I also booked my flights to Minneapolis on the 21st. I'll be helping run the Drupal 8 usability test there, as well as helping run the sprints during Drupalcamp Twin Cities.
