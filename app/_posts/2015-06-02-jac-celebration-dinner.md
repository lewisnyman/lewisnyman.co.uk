title: JAC celebration dinner
---

Last night was was a bad night for me, a good night for jetlag. I slept from 12am–3:30am.

I'm on the train back from London to Haywards Heath after a nice celebration dinner for the [JAC project.](http://jac.judiciary.gov.uk) We've reached what we call the “end of the beginning” of the project and that means everyone involved, client and team, have a nice evening out to celebrate a job done.  I love how much emphasis we put into celebrating our achievements. It's a real morale booster when it's easy to loose track of all the good work that's done over the project.
