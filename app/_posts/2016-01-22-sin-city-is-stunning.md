The Sin City franchise usually draws mixed opinions and I can understand why. The hyper-masculine, ultra-violent, cliched dialogue, neo-noir universe only works if you switch your brain off at the door. Even then it's not easy, you have to be a fan of the genre to understand a franchise that is half parody half homage.

If you haven't read the Sin City books, then I encourage you to at least *look* at them. The artwork is Frank Miller at his best. The way he uses shadows, outlines, and contrast is mesmerising.

Here are some of my favourite panels.
