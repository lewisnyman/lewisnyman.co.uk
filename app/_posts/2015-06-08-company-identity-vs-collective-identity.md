In [Bogota,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJlm58wZCUM) Todd spoke about the idea of a company culture that either focused on the company or focused on the people within.

When we refer to the needs of “the company” who are we really talking about? When I've worked in organisations with a strong heriachy, where reference to the needs and objectives of the company are basically the needs of management. When working in flatter organisations, I rarely hear a reference to the needs of “the company”. There are more “we”s and “I”s.

Now, I listen out for “the company”  as a culture smell, a sign of people's needs being overriden by management.
