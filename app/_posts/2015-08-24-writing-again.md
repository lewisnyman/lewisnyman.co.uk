title: Writing again
---

It's been a while since I've written here. The trip to Minneapolis in June threw my mojo off and once I lost my routine it became easy to not write.

Loads has happened in the past two months! I spoke at [Drupal Camp North,](http://drupalcampnorth.org/) I sprinted on Drupal 8 at [Wunderkraut Munich.](https://groups.drupal.org/node/474418) I just got back from Dublin where I attended the last excellent [HybridConf.](hybridconf.net) It was a common theme of conversation how much the conference would be missed.

I'm going to miss Hybrid, like [Build,](http://2013.buildconf.com/) and [New Adventures in Web Design](http://newadventuresconf.com/) before it. It feels like a friendly home, and it's really hard to pull that off.

I hope we find a way of producing this kind of conference without expecting someone to burn out or lose money year-on-year.
