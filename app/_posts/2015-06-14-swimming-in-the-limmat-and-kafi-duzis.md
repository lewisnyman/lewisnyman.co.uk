Last night our neighbors had a party that lasted until 7am. Fuck them.

Despite that ruining the morning, I had a great day. I helped Emma get Jekyll up and running on her local so she could play around with her personal site. I also drew a few wireframes based on her content requirements to get her started. 

Then I went running with my Vibrams, tri-shorts, and a waterproof bag to stash my gear. I ran and swam up and down the Limmat river. It's my favourite summer past time in ZÃ¼rich. 

Then I raced Josef to [Kafi Duzis](http://www.kafiduzis.ch/) where they had a bad and an awesome live band playing. The heavens opened but that didn't stop the fun.
