What a crazy year. Not just for all the world events, but for all the events and experiences Emma and I subjected ourselves to.

[We moved out](http://lewisnyman.co.uk/blog/moving-out/) of our flat in Haywards Heath in July and travelled all over the UK. This year we completed 9 housesits, looked after 14 dogs, 30 or so chickens, and a pair of guinea pigs. 

I was considering covering the housesitting stuff in other posts, but it's been such an integral part of the year the post would be quite empty. If you like stories about dogs eating things they shouldn't, and dogs poo, including where those two particular topics intersect, stay tuned for other blog posts.

## Travel

This year we stayed in Paris, Huez, Manchester, Bristol, Bournemouth, York, Pickering, Partridge Green, Brighton, Bordeaux, Bergerac, Skye, Edinburgh, Huddersfield, Shropshire, Ruthin, Sheffield, Cramlington, Maidstone, and Tybroughton. 

That's quite a lot isn't it? Considering we only moved out in July. If we housesit across all over 2018, I think 20 locations is a good number to aim for.

I'm quite excited about continuing to house sit for at least another six months. We've learned a lot about various aspects of how to house sit so far, and I think we can do it a lot better with all this experience behind us. We already have a few exciting house sits confirmed for 2018.

## Skiing

We went skiing for the first time on Alp d'Huez.

## Finance

I've never had a finance-related section in an annual review, but I think it's worth a mention this year. In November 2016 I officially paid off all my credit card debt in full and haven't dipped back into it since. I've become an expert at living within my own financial means and I have to credit [You Need a Budget](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=9DHJYq2fpACRcLjn&utm_source=customer_referral) for that. Without their philosophy on budgeting and a really well designed site and mobile app I wouldn't be in such a great position now. I would not hestitate to recommend it, [here's a referral link.](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=9DHJYq2fpACRcLjn&utm_source=customer_referral)

I've started investing money here and there. I started using [Nutmeg](https://www.nutmeg.com/) which is a simple managed investment portfolio service. The fees aren't huge, and it's worth the money over putting it into a high street bank cash ISAs, where you'll struggle to keep up with inflation. I like it.

I've also been chucking bits of money around into investments I like the look of. Notably [Wild Beer Co,](https://www.crowdcube.com/companies/the-wild-beer-co/pitches/bgNOwZ) [Brewdog,](https://www.brewdog.com/equityforpunks?referred_by=R562392) and [Grind.](https://www.crowdcube.com/companies/grind) All young, independent, British-owned businesses. I know Brewdog has it's fair share of critics but in my eyes they are still a business with a strong heart and principles.

I didn't invest in cryptocurrency, which is partly for [moral reasons](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/bitcoins-insane-energy-consumption-explained/) and partly because it was a huge faff.

## Beer

2017 was a good year for beer. I visited the Brewdog Brewery in Ellon. It was great fun! It was facinating to see how the brewery has grown so quickly, and to get a feel for the kind of company it is become.
