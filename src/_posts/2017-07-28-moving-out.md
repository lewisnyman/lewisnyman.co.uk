It's official! Today we returned the keys to our flat and replaced them with keys to a padlock on a storage unit. We're technically "without fixed abode" for the foreseeable future.

We're going to be living in a mixture of housesits, Airbnbs, hotels, and with friends and family.

Starting today, we're going to be staying in Bournemouth, Bristol, Sussex, Brighton, Bordeaux, Bergerac, Scotland, London, Shrewsbury, Yorkshire, and Wales. We still have a few gaps to fill up the rest of the year, but it's nice to keep things flexible.

Travelling is fun and great to broaden your perspective in life. We've already met some great people and experienced some stunning places in the housesits we've already done. I've been thinking about doing this ever since we returned from Zurich one-and-a-half years ago, and it's something I've been working towards for the past six months.

Emma and I are in a rare and envious situation where we can both work from where ever we want, and it feels wrong not to try and do something people would dream to do if they could.

Hoping to see you around on our travels.
