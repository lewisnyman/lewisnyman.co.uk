Working in a flexi-time culture has it's benefits. It gives you the freedom to look after yourself, maintain the quality of your work, and find a good work/life balance. It also requires trust, between your team and with any external clients. Without trust, the whole system quickly falls apart. Here are some of the techniques we use to build trust that allows us to work in a flexible manner.

## Working out loud

‚ÄúHow can I trust someone is working if I can't see them?‚Äù is a common question for organisations considering remote working. Convivio is a fully distributed company, we believe in visible working to build trust and empathy between the team. We use a lot of Slack integrations, that output commits, deployments, design updates, and feedback into project chat rooms. 

We encourage working out loud. For example, if I'm struggling to figure out a problem, I'll mention it in the chat, and that I'm taking a 5 minute break away from the desk to mull it over. When you're not sitting across from each other in an office, you completely miss the body language and other cues on colleagues mental state.

We also use the Slack status feature to update each other on our whereabouts, be it üöÇ commuting to a client office, ‚òïÔ∏è working from a coffee shop, or üèãÔ∏è‚Äç at the gym.

## Peer review all the things

We don't believe in strong hierachical management, and we don't have one person or department that approves all time off and holiday. We rely on peer review to get a secondary opinion on time off, training, and equipment expenses.

This raises awareness of the impact of what is being reviewed, which can be workload or finance related. 

Who your peers are depends on what you're asking to be reviewed. If you're requesting holiday time during the project, you'd speak to your project team. If you're requesting a review for a conference, you'd speak to people who do the same work as you. This has the added benefit of making people aware of conferences they might be interested in.

## Minimum holiday time

When you have a fixed maximum holiday time it's easy to plan throughout the year to make sure you use it all up before the end of the year. When you remove that limitation, things become a lot less structured. We've found that we've had to keep an eye out for people who haven't taken time off for a while, especially if they are working on high pressure projects. 

We even built a little tool that checks our calendar for our last holiday. It looks like I'm slacking!

Working towards a flexi-time, self-managing culture isn't easy, and it's a priviledge you have to earn. It takes time, reflection, and honesty to get it right. We're still learning how  to get better at it and would love to hear your thoughts and ideas.
