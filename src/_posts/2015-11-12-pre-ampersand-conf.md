Whoops! Turns out you shouldn't write a blog title “Writing Again”. That's a bit of a jinx and it means you won't write again for another three months.

I've had a good week this week. A fair amount of designing without development. More than I expected to do and more than I've done in a long time which is a nice surprise. 

Tomorrow is [Ampersand Conf 2015.](http://2015.ampersandconf.com) I had a good chat with some of the attendees over a burger and beers and I'm looking forward to it.

Best keep it short and sweet. In case I use up my writing juices for another three months.

Chao!
