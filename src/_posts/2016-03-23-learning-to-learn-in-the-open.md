title: Learning to learn in the open
---

I'm 29 and I bought a skateboard. I don't know how to “use” a skateboard, is that what the kids call it? Or is it ride? Anyway, they've always baffled and damaged me. Why am I doing this to myself?! One of my goals for this year is to become better at learning in the open, and failing without fear. 

Learning to ride a skateboard isn't fun, it's less fun if you're close to thirty. I get weird looks from old and young as I hobble down the street, arms flailing, one foot on the board. You have to learn to skate in public. 

It's impossible not to feel judged. Should I be doing this? Surely I'm too old? Hasn't my window of opportunity passed? Literally everyone younger than me is better at this than me.

I notice having these thoughts often during work. Impostor syndrome is common but few people openly talk about it. Everyone is too worried about being exposed or vulnerable.

A lot of modern work environments are very ego-centric. Everyone is carefully protecting their image because they fear exposing their weaknesses to their peers. This is a terrible way to learn! This is really harmful to development.

If you're preoccupied with failure, you create mental barriers to learning and development.

So that's why I'm learning to skate. I'm also learning to be better at trying new things, failing, and learning. I want to lead by example and create a culture where others feel free to fail as well.
