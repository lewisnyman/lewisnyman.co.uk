title: Building the Convivio brand — Part 1
---

We started Convivio by embracing the way we love to work, constant and quick iteration in the open. [On day one](https://blog.weareconvivio.com/hello-we-are-convivio-a1128f06d74d#.k6fpy4pmu), all we had was our name.

This week has been my first week working full-time at Convivio. My main responsibility is building up the Convivio brand into a memorable experience that reflects our purpose and values.

We hired [Zach Inglis](https://twitter.com/zachinglis) and [Laura Sanders](https://twitter.com/teawithlemon) to help us bring our thoughts and feelings into a visual identity. This week they ran a branding discovery workshop with us, digging deeper into the ideas and culture behind Convivio.

In preparation for the workshop, we were asked to find images that we felt captured the brand as well as images we felt did not. These could be photos, logos, illustrations, anything.

###Images that feel Convivio

After getting all these up on a wall, Zach and Laura asked us to pick out images we felt strongly about, either for or against.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve started by finding pictures that capture something we think Convivio is, and others that show what we&#39;re not <a href="https://t.co/ocOdThKTre">pic.twitter.com/ocOdThKTre</a></p>&mdash; Convivio (@weareconvivio) <a href="https://twitter.com/weareconvivio/status/747759394423717888">June 28, 2016</a></blockquote>

Next, Laura guided us to talk about why we felt the way we did about the images we picked out, with Zach diligently taking notes.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These concepts were captured in a big word cloud, with larger text showing those mentioned more often... <a href="https://t.co/2Q3Ku9fS6d">pic.twitter.com/2Q3Ku9fS6d</a></p>&mdash; Convivio (@weareconvivio) <a href="https://twitter.com/weareconvivio/status/747766670102528000">June 28, 2016</a></blockquote>

We generated a cloud of information that represented our conversation. It was great seeing these words staring back at us.

This photo is currently the only photo of [Steve Parks](https://twitter.com/steveparks) next to a salad available on the internet. For some reason Steve and I switched places for the photo.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This afternoon, working on our visual identity, we&#39;ve been through books of logos &amp; discussed ones we like and why <a href="https://t.co/3rE0YmXZtz">pic.twitter.com/3rE0YmXZtz</a></p>&mdash; Convivio (@weareconvivio) <a href="https://twitter.com/weareconvivio/status/747795742815846400">June 28, 2016</a></blockquote>

After lunch, slightly sleepier, we went through books of logos. We picked out logos that we liked, or ones we thought did a good job of capturing the brand visually.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally, there&#39;s a discussion about colours. We like natural, healthy, warm colours in some of the chosen images: <a href="https://t.co/tJCnI2xaVR">pic.twitter.com/tJCnI2xaVR</a></p>&mdash; Convivio (@weareconvivio) <a href="https://twitter.com/weareconvivio/status/747801819745779713">June 28, 2016</a></blockquote>

Everyone finished the workshop feeling energised and confident that our feelings about the Convivio brand had been captured. A huge thanks to Zach and Laura for guiding us through this step. We can wait to see what happens next!
