I spent the whole of 2018 travelling from place to place, working from anywhere! The longest we stayed in one place was 6 weeks. 

I'm taking a different approach with this year's annual retrospective. Instead of assessing each area of my life like I'm taking an end-of-year exam. I'm going to list my highlights of the year, my favourite things that I did.

## Edinburgh during the fringe

We were lucky enough to be accepted to housesit in Edinburgh in August during the fringe! I'd never been in Edinburgh during the fringe, but it didn't take long for me to "get it". I now understand why everyone raves about the fringe. Edinburgh is completely transformed in a constant festival. I loved it.

So, why not make the most of staying in Edinburgh during the fringe? In the end I think I saw around 20 shows. My favourites were:

* [Werewolf: Live,](http://werewolflive.co.uk/)
* [BEASTS: Best of BEASTS,](https://twitter.com/beastscomedy)
* [The Dark Room,](https://www.thejohnrobertson.com/thedarkroom/)
* [Rob Kemp: The Elvis Dead,](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/18/rob-kemp-the-elvis-dead-review-a-gory-cult-classic-in-the-making)
* [and The Underground Railroad Game](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/11/underground-railroad-game-review-traverse-edinburgh-fringe-festival)

Also, we got to look after Maybae and Buster.

## Watercolours

In 2018 I challenged myself to do something for 100 days that I was not very good at. So I painted watercolours. Some days were awful, but I definitely improved over time. I love being around water and being in water, so this medium felt pretty fun and relaxing to me.

Here are a few early fails:
