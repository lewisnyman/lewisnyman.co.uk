title: Why I cancelled my Amazon Prime subscription
---

At the start of this year I cancelled my Amazon Prime subscription. The motivations were political and environmental and now I feel the urge to write about them.

Two worrying trends have been in the my mind in the past few years. Economic inequality, and environmental degradation.

## Recognising my Amazon Prime addiction

Amazon Prime's free shipping is, in isolation, a [huge loss leader for Amazon.](http://fortune.com/2015/02/03/inside-amazon-prime/) Yet Amazon push it so much onto customers because it transforms some-time customers to all-the-time customers. The lure of having almost anything arrive the next day is too great.

Amazon became my one-shop for everything. Even if something cost a little more, the knowledge that you can find almost everything in a few taps kept me coming back.

When I moved to Switzerland, I did not realise they didn't have an Amazon service. I felt cut off. I continued to order items on Amazon Prime to a UK address, so I could pick them up when I traveled in for work.

## Watching the wealth gap widen

Amazon's struggle to pay corporation tax is [well known.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/24/amazons-uk-business-paid-119m-tax-last-year) When I moved to Kemptown in Brighton I saw how many local businesses still exist and how they contribute to the local village-style community.

The UK economy is struggling again, it feels wrong to throw more money into the pockets of a non-UK owned company when people around me are struggling.

Did I really want to continue contributing to making the rich even richer? Or do I want to give a helping hand to people who live locally, and contribute to the local community instead of paving over it for profit?

I decided I'd rather pay more and expend more effort to find what I need in my local area.

## My personal environmental footprint

Recycling is good, better than throwing everything into a landfill, everyone knows this. But the process of recycling is also costly to the environment, it costs energy and resources to transform a cardboard box into another cardboard box.

Producing goods costs the environment a lot. Not just creating the thing, but the packaging, printing, shipping, etc. You can help reduce by buying products second-hand, so they don't end up in a landfill while an identical new version is being shipped to you.

I'm trying to reduce and reuse more things. Before buying something, asking myself if I really need it. Removing the endorphin releasing Prime service from my phone was a good barrier to slow down my purchasing decisions.

## My new purchasing workflow

1. Do I really need to own this thing? Can I borrow it?
2. Can I buy it second-hand?
3. Can I buy it from a local, independently owned shops?
4. Can I buy it from a UK-owned business?
5. Ok fine, Amazon
