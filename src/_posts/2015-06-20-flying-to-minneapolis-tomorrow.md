title: Flying to Minneapolis tomorrow
tags: 100 words

Tomorrow I'll be catching a flight to Minneapolis, via Amsterdam. The total travel time is over ten hours, so I'm brainstorming something to be productive with on the trip.

I'm eager to finish <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5463/9780241968581">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a> or maybe start reading <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5463/9780670921348">Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most.</a> I've also been hacking around with Wunderkraut's [hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) instance. We affectionately named him [cato.](https://github.com/WunderRoot/cato)

I'm also really looking forward to improving this site. Now that I'm using it more and more people are visiting it, it feels like a higher priority to me now.
