Inspired by [Jeremy,](https://adactio.com/) I've started the 100 words challenge. 100 words every day for 100 days. I'm surprised how much I enjoyed reading Jeremy's daily slices of life.

This is day two, and I'm jetlagged with nothing else to write about, so I choose to write about the writing challenge. I don't really know what I'm going to write about everyday but I guess that's part of the fun. I hope it's going to encourage me to work on this site a little more, as I start to use it often. I'm using [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com) to write these posts, it's handy!
