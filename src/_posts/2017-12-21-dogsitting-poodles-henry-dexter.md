After an easy and relaxing first housesit with Depp and Janet, it is to be expected that we'd encounter some trickier tougher situations as we gained more experience. Housesit number two was one of those.

We were looking after two poodles in Southbourne, a now-quite-trendy area between Bournemouth and Christchurch. Henry was a miniture poodle with one eye. Dexter was a toy poodle, who made Henry look normal sized.
